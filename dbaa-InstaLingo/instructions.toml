INFO = "Hi, I'm InstaLingo, a bot that is going to teach you French! \n\nTo get started simply type \"g\", and I'll send over a commonly used Phrase in English or French and you need to translate it back to me. \nAlternatively, type EN > _with some French here_ to translate a French sentence into English, or type FR > _with some English here_ to translate an English sentence into a French one. How easy! \n\nHappy learning!\n\np.s. Don't build an app ;)"
